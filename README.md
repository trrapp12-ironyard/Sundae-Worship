### This project demonstrates:
---

- [x] Initiative.  
  * This began as an assignment from Iron Yard coding camp. 
  
  * The original project required the use of html tables to create tabular data.  I completed the project, then came back to see if I could challenge myself.  So I refactored the code to:
 - [x] create a JavaScript object with the name and the individual data for each object
 - [x] create a JavaScript function that pulled in the information, sorted it alphabetically, built a table, and then displayed the information in it's own cells. 
  
### The original requirements for this project were:
---

- [x] Build a homepage for your local ice cream shop. 
- [x] Initialize and push/pull to a GitHub repository.
- [x] Regular commits and use proper semantic HTML tags.
- [x] Include 
  * the shop's name
  * a brief history (use lorem ipsum)
  * a logo (any image you can find online)
  * the store's hours and contact information
  * flavors available (list at least 5 and no more than 42) with:
  * name, calorie count, and whether it is sugar free or not
  * a link to Wikipedia for that flavor
- [x] See every other flavor on the menu alternate its background color (commonly called "zebra striping")
- [x] Restrictions:
  * don't use any libraries, extension, modules, or frameworks other than normalize.css and font-awesome flexbox
  * don't use animations such as CSS3 or canvas.  You may use animated gifs, but keep them portfolio professional if you do.
  * don't use tables for layout of anything other than actual tabular data (depending on your design the ice cream flavors, whether they’re sugar free or not, and their calories may qualify as tabular data)
- [x] Use ```<aside>``` and CSS to create a left side-column with margins.
- [x] Create Mobile Responsive design
- [x] Create Social Media links

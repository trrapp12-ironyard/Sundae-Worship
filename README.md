### This project demonstrates:
---
#### Version 1.0
- [x] Initiative.  
  * This project has gone through three distinctive versions.  The first version was the most basic, day-one introductory assignment from Iron Yard coding camp. All it required were: 
  
- [x] Build a homepage for your local ice cream shop. 
- [x] Initialize and push/pull to a GitHub repository.
- [x] Regular commits and use proper semantic HTML tags.
- [x] Include 
  * the shop's name
  * a brief history (use lorem ipsum)
  * a logo (any image you can find online)
  * the store's hours and contact information
  * flavors available (list at least 5 and no more than 42) with:
  * name, calorie count, and whether it is sugar free or not
  * a link to Wikipedia for that flavor
- [x] See every other flavor on the menu alternate its background color (commonly called "zebra striping")
- [x] Restrictions:
  * don't use any libraries, extension, modules, or frameworks other than normalize.css and font-awesome flexbox
  * don't use animations such as CSS3 or canvas.  You may use animated gifs, but keep them portfolio professional if you do.
  * don't use tables for layout of anything other than actual tabular data (depending on your design the ice cream flavors, whether theyâ€™re sugar free or not, and their calories may qualify as tabular data)
- [x] Use ```<aside>``` and CSS to create a left side-column with margins.
- [x] Create Mobile Responsive design
- [x] Create Social Media links

#### Version 2.0

But that wasn't enough for me.  I wanted to make it better.  Even though it was my first project, I wanted to show that I could improve on it, so I refactored the code to:

 - [x] create a JavaScript object 
 - [x] place that JavaScript object in a file that had to be imported to practice connecting html to JavaScript files.  
 - [x] create a JavaScript object that included with the name and the individual data for each type of ice cream.
 - [x] create a JavaScript function that imported the information, iterated through an object with multiple levels, sorted it alphabetically, and then use JavaScript to dynamically built a full table complete with `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` elements which each contain the correct information and styling.
 
#### Version 3.0

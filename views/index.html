          <p class="sidebar sidebar-text">Sundae Worship began like every good love story -- with two young people who are brought together over a scoop of ice-cream, the first blushes of love and copious amounts of unhealthy obsession.  <br><br> Except there was only one person (a lonely bachelor), no love, and only an empty carton of Ben and Jerry's to go with the copious amounts of unhealthy obsession. <br><br> This project began as an introductory project in a coding bootcamp.  It was supposed to be a single static webpage which used HTML &lt;table&gt; tags to create a menu on a static website.  Over the years I have come back to it again and again.  The static tables made in html were updated to tables drawn with JavaScript.  <br><br> I was successful at that.  <br><br> But then that wasn’t enough.  I thought why not just build a backend with MVC architecture.  And I was successful at that.  So here it is today.  A beautiful project made with a little bit of love and an unwarranted amount of obsession.
